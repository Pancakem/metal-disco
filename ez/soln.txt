To start:
	strings --data run.exe
This reveals:
	P455w0rdYou Got This!
	Wrong!

P455w0rd looks like the obvious key:

./run.exe P455w0rd
gives the result: You Got This!

However on disassembly the compare is done with a dword, 4 bytes.
	0x08049008 <+8>:	cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [ebx]

./run.exe P455
gives the result: You Got This!
